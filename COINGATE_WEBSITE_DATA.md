# 📝 CoinGate Website Section - What to Add

## 🎯 Website Field - Options:

### Option 1: If You Have a Domain (Best)
**Add your actual website:**
```
https://yourdomain.com
```
(Replace with your real domain if you have one)

---

### Option 2: If Testing/Localhost
**For testing purposes:**
```
https://localhost:4000
```
(Your local development server)

**Note:** This works for testing, but for production you'll need a real domain.

---

### Option 3: Sample Domain (If No Domain Yet)
**Use a placeholder:**
```
https://cryptoacademypro.com
